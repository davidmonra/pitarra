How To Play:

1. At the start of the game, each player has 12 tokens.

2. Each turn, a player places a token on the board.

3. When one player lines up 3 tokens in a row (vertically 
   horizontally or diagonally), that player gets to take 
   one of the other player's tokens off the board.

4. Once both players have put all of their tokens on the 
   board, then they can start moving their tokens to open 
   spots to try and get 3 in a row.

5. Tokens can only be moved one spot at a time to open 
   spots. No jumping allowed.

6. If a player can't move any of their tokens, they lose 
   their turn.

7. The game is a draw if all of the tokens for both players 
   are on the board and there are no open spots left. 

8. The players keep playing until one player has less than 
   3 tokens on the board.
