Sprint 3 Retrospective


= Details =

*What should we start doing?*

L.- Write down what consensus we agreed on so we can remember it.

JL - testing more strenuously

JS- We're pretty much done. It would have been nice if we could have gotten svn working the way it was supposed to. I just used it for update/commit. I never could get it to compile Java projects. Ditto on JL's comment.

*What should we stop doing?*

L.- Forgetting what we agreed upon.

JL - adding more on top of what we have

JS- ???

*What should we continue doing?*

L.- Great communication.

JL - working steadily

JS- Distributing tasks efficiently.
