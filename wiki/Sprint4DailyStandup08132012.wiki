*What will you do today?*

L.- Client meeting on 8/13, continue writing User Manual.

MAG-AS of now nothing

JS- Got most of it working, but still trying to get the mouse event redispatching to work from glass pane to sub panels and vice/versa.

PHP- nothing stands in my way to complete this project...NOTHING!! MUAHAHAHAHAHA
